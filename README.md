# Stone Paper Scissors Game (C++)

## Description

This project is a console-based **Stone–Paper–Scissors** game implemented in **C++**. The player competes against the computer over multiple rounds. The computer’s choices are generated randomly, and the game tracks wins, losses, and draws before announcing the final winner.

The project focuses on practicing core C++ concepts such as enums, structs, functions, loops, conditionals, and basic input/output handling.
